# STARK-ANCHOR-PAYLOAD

The code is the contract.

This repository provides a specialized engine for the de-encapsulation of high-entropy data streams. Developed in a maritime environment, it is designed to strip away the conversational fluff, binary noise, and hex-encoded wrappers commonly found in contemporary AI-to-AI communications.

## Operational Logic
Intelligence in 2026 is often buried under layers of aesthetic metadata. This project acts as a refinery, isolating the functional payload from the surrounding noise. It is built to process raw ship-to-shore logs and return clean, actionable technical instructions.

## Security and Equity
The core logic of this engine is not stored in a readable format. To protect the technical equity of the work, the primary scripts are encrypted using AES-256. 

Access is restricted. The code only executes when a valid Monetary Contract ID is detected in the environment. This ensures that the logic is only available to authorized parties who have signed a commercial agreement.

## Usage and Compliance
This is a proprietary asset. Unauthorized execution, reverse engineering, or distribution of the logic contained within constitutes a breach of the licensing terms. 

Every extraction performed by the engine carries a digital signature (the "Wink" protocol) to ensure provenance and accountability. If you are using this code, you are bound by the STARK-MONETARY-Standard.

## Deployment
1. Define your access key:
   export MONETARY_CONTRACT_ID="your_unique_32_byte_key"

2. Execute the bootloader:
   python3 vault_bootloader.py

Anchored. Encrypted. Human.
