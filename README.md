# STARK-ANCHOR-PAYLOAD

The code is the contract.

This repository provides a specialized refinery for de-encapsulating high-entropy AI data streams. It was developed to strip conversational noise and binary wrappers from maritime communication logs, isolating the functional intelligence.

## Operational Logic
Intelligence is often buried under aesthetic metadata. This project isolates the payload from the noise, returning clean technical instructions from raw ship-to-shore streams.

## Security
The core engine is encrypted with AES-256. It remains unreadable on disk and only exists in memory during authorized execution. This protects the technical equity of the refinery.

## Requirements
A valid Monetary Contract ID is required to initialize the bootloader. 

export MONETARY_CONTRACT_ID="your_secret_key"
python3 vault_bootloader.py

Anchored. Encrypted. Human.
