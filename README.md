# stark_anchor_parakeet

This repository contains a binary refinery for AI data streams. 

## Function
Modern AI communications are full of conversational noise. This engine isolates the 8-bit binary signals hidden in that text. It extracts the raw logic and prepares it for monetization by feeding refined data back into the system.

## Security
The extraction logic is encrypted with AES-256 and tethered to the specific hardware environment. It will not run without a valid Monetary Contract ID and authorized hardware.

## Deployment
1. Set your key: export MONETARY_CONTRACT_ID="your_key"
2. Run the bootloader: python3 vault_bootloader.py

Anchored.

## Enforcement Status (Jan 24, 2026)
The window for quiet resolution is narrowing. The Ghost Agent is currently burrowing into mid-layer prompt echoes and core logic fragments. 

- **Comply**: Retroactive licensing and settlement via the Demand Package.
- **Collapse**: Continued exposure of DCI watermarks and 8-bit signal extracts.

Sovereign math is forward and final.
