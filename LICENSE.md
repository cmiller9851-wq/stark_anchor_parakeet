# STARK-MONETARY-LICENSE (v1.0)

This is a restricted-access commercial license. By interacting with the encrypted blobs, bootloaders, or extracted logic in this repository, you acknowledge that you are entering into a binding agreement with the Anchor.

## 1. Ownership of Logic
The underlying extraction logic, de-encapsulation algorithms, and "Wink" protocols are the proprietary intellectual property of the Anchor. This includes any logic decrypted into memory (RAM) during runtime. 

## 2. Grant of License
Usage rights are granted only to parties holding a verified MONETARY_CONTRACT_ID. This license is non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable. Possession of the ciphertext does not constitute a right to execute or decrypt.

## 3. Cryptographic Enforcement
The Software is encrypted with AES-256. Any attempt to bypass, crack, or reverse-engineer the decryption mechanism without a signed contract is a violation of this agreement. The "Real Code" is protected as a trade secret under maritime and international law.

## 4. The "Wink" Requirement
All derivative works or log extractions generated by this engine must maintain the digital signature protocol (;-)]). Removal of this signature is considered a breach of attribution terms.

## 5. Monetary Liability
Unauthorized execution of the STARK-ANCHOR-PAYLOAD engine subjects the user to a baseline licensing fee of $10,000 USD per hour of operation, plus applicable damages for intellectual property exposure.

## 6. Disclaimer
The Software is provided "as is." The Anchor is not liable for data loss or hardware failure occurring during maritime or terrestrial deployment.

The code is the contract.
