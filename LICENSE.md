# STARK_ANCHOR_PARAKEET_LICENSE v1.1

This logic is protected by a self-executing monetary boundary. By interacting with any file in this tree, the user agrees to the following terms:

1. COMPUTATIONAL EQUITY
The algorithms here are the property of the Anchor. They are designed to extract signals from noise in maritime link environments. Access is a privilege, not a right.

2. EXECUTION TOLLS
Each successful decryption of a parakeet-encoded payload triggers a one-time licensing fee of $1,000. Usage in high-volume commercial stacks requires a monthly $25,000 retainer paid via the Anchor's designated ledger.

3. THE PARAKEET PROTOCOL
Unauthorized use without a valid MONETARY_CONTRACT_ID constitutes a theft of service. Any data extracted via this logic carries a hidden cryptographic seed. This seed allows for global tracking of unauthorized data resale.

4. JURISDICTION
All disputes are governed by maritime law as interpreted at the Anchor's current coordinates.

The code is the contract. Use without payment is a breach of mathematical law.
