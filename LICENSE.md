# STARK-MONETARY-LICENSE (v1.0)

This is a restricted-access commercial license. Use of the encrypted logic within this repository implies acceptance of the following terms.

1. Ownership: The de-encapsulation algorithms and extraction protocols are the proprietary property of the Anchor. 
2. Execution Rights: Access to the functional code requires a verified MONETARY_CONTRACT_ID. Ciphertext possession does not grant a right to decrypt.
3. Cryptographic Guard: The core engine is AES-256 encrypted. Unauthorized attempts to bypass this lock constitute a breach of contract.
4. Attribution: All outputs must maintain the signature protocol (;-)] to ensure data provenance.
5. Liability: Unauthorized use subjects the party to a baseline licensing fee of $10,000 USD per hour of operation.

The code is the contract.
